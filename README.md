# Screenshot Detector

A library for detecting when a user has taken a screenshot for Android and IOS.

## Getting Started

This project uses native IOS and Android >14 code from the official documentation to check if the
user has taken a screenshot. Android versions below 14 use a contentresolver to check if a
screenshot has been taken, so you need to grant read storage permission to work correctly.
